                Welcome to my site. My name is Gustavo Valenzuela and I am learning how to code to become a full stack web developer. In the <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page of this website you will find projects that I have finished or am currently working on. In the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page you'll find a form you may use to contact me.   
            </p>
            <p>
                For as long as I can remember, I have been extremely fascinating by the world wide web and have observed how it has evolved over the years. From simple text-based sites, to animations, flash, embedded video, to now HTML5, Javascript, and beyond. I decided to learn how to code in order to deploy websites myself and possibly others as a career. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please take a look around at my portfolio and if maybe you like what you see, shoot me an email. Hope to hear from you! Have a wonderful day =]
